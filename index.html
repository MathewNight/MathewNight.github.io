        <div>
            Hello, I am Mathew. <br>
            I am a developer on the platform known as <a id="robloxfont">rOblox</a>. <br>
            I've worked on this platform for 6 years as a Developer and as a person who missed the old era. <br>
            Usually my maps and quite underrated, but on daily I am interested in improving my abilities further. <br>
            <br>
            On the side of things, I have managed to perform things like: <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Creating Friday Night Funkin custom character sprites.</li>
            <li>Rigging (Blender(alt. known as Armature) / Roblox)</li>
            <li>Modeling (Blender)</li>
            <li>Animations (Game Idle Animations)</li>
            <li>Video Trailers (Editing Software and possibly Moon Animator)</li>
            <li>Open-sourcing ROBLOX maps for commercial use.</li>
            <li>Creating ROBLOX maps, for Influencers, Developers and alike.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <li>Why do I use this website as a portfolio instead of the TalentHub or Cardd?</li>
            The reason is simple for each of the websites. <br>
            TalentHub has a lot of flaws. Inability to upload videos and moderating links that lead outside of Roblox that are not hurtful.
            <br>
            Cardd is simply not enough to customize for a developer's portfolio as you require subscriptions that you need to pay monthly.
            <br><br>
            <li>What are the prices for commission/short-term/long-term?</li>
            The projects are all based on how much I have to do and if I am working under a team or not.<br>
            Things mostly in mind I take when working under a team is the ability to talk with all of the team's developers using voice communication.<br>
    
            <br>
            <li>What's the payment method?</li>
            I'd appreciate the method of payment with Robux. Payment will be half upfront and if I am done, I'll take the other half to make sure.
            <br>The payment amount will be to negatotiate based on the project and it's current audience.
            <br><br>
            cuz i like talking 2 people :D

                Crucial Horizons is a Critical Adventure-themed game that is 
                about hitting flying tokens around the battleground.<br>

                CH potentially is different to the other CA games as it has it's own 
                unique core coded from scratch to make sure the code can be used to 
                improve or add to the game new features.<br>

                    Crucial Journey: Remastered, is a game that's similar to Critical Adventure.<br>
                    CJR is about walking around dodging enemy attacks while hitting tokens to deal damage to the enemy.
                    <br>
                    The game itself is not in the best condition of seriousness as it has a huge ton of references included in it such as DOOM, TouHou and etc.
